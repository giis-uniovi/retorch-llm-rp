Objective: Generate receipts with the members' dues to be sent to the bank
Scenario:
- Administration requests the system to prepare the monthly invoicing of receipts, choosing to generate the current ones for all members to be invoiced for the current month and/or those to be reissued.
- If current receipts are to be generated, the system generates the receipts pending collection for each member according to the periodicity and quota criteria established for each one.
- If reissued receipts are to be generated, the system re-sets the quota by generating a new receipt for those that had been returned with the quota established for the member.
- The system generates an exchange file with the Bank in accordance with the CSB19 standard. The generated receipts are grouped in a Batch.
Administration will send this file to the Bank by e-mail
