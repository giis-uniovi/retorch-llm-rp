## Unnecessary Steps

Each scenario is designed to be as concise as possible while still covering all necessary actions. However, if any
scenario includes redundant navigation or confirmation steps that do not add value to the testing process, those could
be streamlined. For example, if the system automatically redirects to the dashboard after login, the step to navigate to
the dashboard could be considered unnecessary.
